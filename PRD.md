## Edge Case Handling

- **No JavaScript**: Progressive enhancement ensures core content remains accessible even without JavaScript
- **Slow connections**: Content loads progressively with skeleton states to maintain engagement
- **Mobile devices**: Responsive design adapts complex visualizations to smaller screens with simplified interactions
- **Older browsers**: Graceful degradation maintains functionality across browser versions
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support for all interactive elements

## Design Direction

The design should project **institutional authority, technical sophistication, and German precision**. It must balance accessibility for non-technical decision-makers with depth for IT professionals. The aesthetic should feel like a high-end consulting presentation—polished, data-driven, and uncompromisingly professional. Visual elements should reference law enforcement (subtle badge/shield motifs, network diagrams) and German design traditions (clarity, functionality, minimal ornamentation).

## Color Selection

A sophisticated palette that conveys trust, security, and German public service.

- **Primary Color (Deep Navy)**: oklch(0.25 0.05 250) - Conveys authority, security, and institutional trust
- **Secondary Color (Professional Gray)**: oklch(0.45 0.01 240) - Supporting neutral for backgrounds and less prominent elements
- **Accent Color (Signal Red)**: oklch(0.55 0.22 25) - Attention-grabbing for CTAs and critical information, references German federal colors
- **Background (Light Warm Gray)**: oklch(0.97 0.005 60) - Soft, professional background that reduces eye strain
- **Surface (Pure White)**: oklch(1 0 0) - Clean card surfaces and content areas
- **Text Primary (Near Black)**: oklch(0.15 0.01 250) - High-contrast readable text

**Foreground/Background Pairings**:
- Primary (Deep Navy #2B3A67): White text (#FFFFFF) - Ratio 11.2:1 ✓
- Accent (Signal Red #C94A3A): White text (#FFFFFF) - Ratio 4.9:1 ✓
- Background (Light Warm Gray #F7F6F4): Text Primary (#20212E) - Ratio 14.8:1 ✓
- Secondary (Professional Gray #5D6278): White text (#FFFFFF) - Ratio 7.1:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography must balance German design sensibilities (clarity, legibility) with contemporary professionalism.

- **Headings**: Space Grotesk - A geometric sans-serif with distinctive character that projects modernity and precision without sacrificing readability
- **Body Text**: Inter - A highly legible interface font optimized for screens, conveying clarity and professionalism

**Typographic Hierarchy**:
- H1 (Hero Title): Space Grotesk Bold/48px/tight leading/-0.02em tracking
- H2 (Section Headers): Space Grotesk SemiBold/36px/tight leading/-0.01em tracking
- H3 (Subsection Headers): Space Grotesk Medium/24px/normal leading
- Body Large (Intro Text): Inter Regular/20px/relaxed leading
- Body (Standard Text): Inter Regular/16px/relaxed leading
- Caption (Metadata): Inter Medium/14px/normal leading/uppercase

## Animations

Animations should feel **precise and purposeful**, reflecting German engineering principles—nothing frivolous, every motion serves a functional purpose. Entry animations use subtle upward motion with slight opacity changes (respecting reduced-motion preferences). Interactive elements respond with micro-interactions that provide immediate feedback. The architecture visualization includes smooth transitions between states. Hover effects are subtle but distinct, confirming interactivity without distraction.

## Component Selection

  - Accordion (Shadcn): Expandable scenario details and FAQ sections
  - Badge (Shadcn): Labels for statistics, technology tags, and feature highlights

  - Buttons: Default with slight shadow, hover with elevation increase, active with subtle scale
  - Cards: Default flat, hover with shadow lift and subtle scale, active/selected with accent border
  - Interactive layers: Default with opacity, hover highlighted with glow, selected with full opacity and detail panel
